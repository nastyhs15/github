The intersection of live entertainment and social justice movements has been around for as long as popular music has existed, from Bob Dylan readily crooning his anti-Vietnam war sentiments to N.W.A being arrested at a Detroit concert for performing “Fuck tha Police” to Bikini Kill protesting through song and dance at the Pro-Choice Rally at the National Mall.
